Having multiple assets, we have multiple threat sources.\newline 
We have the following assets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web application
    \item Database
    \item CI/CD
    \item Image repository
    \item Container orchestration
    \item Secrets
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Threat sources}

Web application: Runs on HTTP, making it vulnerable to data leaks and replay attacks. Possible XSS vulnerabilities due to HTML rendering.\\\\
Database: Usernames and emails are stored in clear-text; passwords are salted and hashed, to defend against rainbow-table attacks.
User IDs increment sequentially, which is not best practice.The same database credentials are used for both staging and production.\\\\
CI/CD: GitHub actions has access to all secrets.
We use the following NPM packages for release versioning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "semantic-release-github-actions-tags": "\textasciicircum1.0.3"
    \item "semantic-release/git": "\textasciicircum8.0.0"
\end{itemize}

Images are publicly stored on DockerHub, with clear-text credentials on the staging server. The codebase is public on GitHub.\\\\
Other: Multiple open ports on servers, potentially including logging endpoints.

\subsubsection{Risk scenarios}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |p{3.5cm}|c|c|c|p{2.5cm}| } 
 \hline
 Scenario & Probability & Impact & Risk & Strategy / Action\\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline
 An adversary listens to the non-encrypted data sent on our web application. This is possible because we use HTTP and not HTTPS
 & 5 & 5 & 25 & Get an SSL-certificate and redirect all traffic to HTTPS\\
\hline
 An adversary finds an open port on one of our nodes and gains access to our system & 3 & 5 & 15 & Run Nmap, close unused ports\\
 \hline 
 An adversary constructs a message that escapes HTML and runs code when rendered (XSS) & 3 & 5 & 15 & Sanitize user input\\
 \hline
  An adversary finds our Docker images online & 3 & 1 & 3 & Make image repository private\\ 
 \hline
 An adversary hijacks the cookie of a user & 1 & 2 & 2 & Unavoidable\\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\noindent We have not had time to harden our system, due to our focus primarily being on making the infrastructure.
