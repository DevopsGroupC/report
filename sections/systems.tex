\section{Systems}


Design of the CSharp-MiniTwit systems
Architecture of your CSharp-MiniTwit systems
All dependencies of your Csharp-MiniTwit systems on all levels of abstraction and development stages.

That is, list and briefly describe all technologies and tools you applied and depend on.

Important interactions of subsystems

Current state of your systems, for example using results of static analysis and quality assessment systems.

Double check that for all the weekly tasks (those in the end of the lecture notes) you include the corresponding information.

MSc students remember to argue for the choice of technologies and decisions for at least all cases for which we asked you to do so in the tasks at the end of each session.
